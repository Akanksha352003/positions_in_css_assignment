        Task no. 2 - Differernce between Absolute and Relative Positioning.
      </h2>
    <h3>Relative Positioning:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        When an element is set to position: relative;, it is positioned relative
        to its normal position in the document flow.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you move a relatively positioned element, it will be offset from its
        normal position, but the space it originally occupied will still be
        reserved. Other elements on the page will not be affected by its
        movement.
      </li>
      <li>
        Child elements with position: absolute; inside a relatively positioned
        container are positioned relative to that container.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Absolute Positioning:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>When an element is set to position: absolute;, it is positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (an ancestor with any position value other than static) or, if none exists, relative to the initial containing block (usually the viewport).</li>
        <li>Absolute positioning removes the element from the normal document flow. It won't reserve space for the element in the layout, and other elements will ignore it when positioning themselves.</li>
        <li>If no positioned ancestor is found, the element will be positioned relative to the initial containing block, which is the viewport.</li>

    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>In summary, <em>position: relative;</em> positions an element relative to its normal position, and its movement can affect the layout of other elements. On the other hand, <em>position: absolute;</em> positions an element relative to its nearest positioned ancestor or the viewport and takes it out of the normal document flow, affecting the layout less predictably.</p>
